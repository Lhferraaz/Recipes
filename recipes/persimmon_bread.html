        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the limelight (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!). The humble persimmon is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.

        <p>
            Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.
